## Don't make me think

- Number **1** rule of web usability: **Don't make users think**
- Web pages should be *self-evident*.
- A user should immediately grok whatever page they land on
    - Names, labels etc. should be obvious. `Jobs` > `Employment Opportunities` > `Job-o-rama`
    - Links and buttons should be clearly clickable
- Users shouldn't spend time thinking about questions such as:
    - Where am I?
    - Where should I begin?
    - Where did they put ____ ?
    - What are the most important things on this page?
    - Why did they call it that?
- If you can't make a page *self-evident* make it *self-explanatory*. This is the case when building something novel which requires designing outside of established templates/patterns.
- Motivation:
    - Making pages self-evident improves a user's impression of the whole product
    - Most users spend very little time looking at the pages we design. Self-evident pages are the most effective.
