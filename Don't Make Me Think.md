## Don't make me think

- Number **1** rule of web usability: **Don't make users think**
- Web pages should be *self-evident*.
- A user should immediately grok whatever page they land on
    - Names, labels etc. should be obvious. `Jobs` > `Employment Opportunities` > `Job-o-rama`
    - Links and buttons should be clearly clickable
- Users shouldn't spend time thinking about questions such as:
    - Where am I?
    - Where should I begin?
    - Where did they put ____ ?
    - What are the most important things on this page?
    - Why did they call it that?
- If you can't make a page *self-evident* make it *self-explanatory*. This is the case when building something novel which requires designing outside of established templates/patterns.
- Motivation:
    - Making pages self-evident improves a user's impression of the whole product
    - Most users spend very little time looking at the pages we design. Self-evident pages are the most effective.

## How we really use the web

- Expectation: Users will examine each page, reading, and trying to understand it
- Reality: Users glance at each page. They scan quickly to find what they've come for
- Facts about web use
    - **#1 We don't read pages. We scan them.**
        - We're usually in a hurry.
        - We don't care about most stuff on a page. We're looking for specific things of interest.
        - We scan for words & phrases that match our current task or our general interests.
    - **#2 We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.**
        - We don't choose the *best* option. We choose the first *reasonable* option we come across.
        - We're usually in a hurry. Optimizing is time consuming.
        - There's not much of a penalty for guessing wrong. (This seems like a principle for designing. i.e. as a designer/developer make sure that if users make an incorrect choice, they can always quickly and easily back out of it.)
    - **#3 We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.**
        - Most users don't read instructions and they don't form a mental model of how the software works. They come up with a vaguely plausible working model that allows them to get stuff done.
        - It's not important to users *how* software works.
        - If we find a solution we don't deviate in the future. i.e. we don't look for better solutions.
- If you can design something that users just "get" then:
    - There's a better chance they'll use the full range of what you offer
    - There's a better chance they'll be successful
    - You can steer them better
    - They'll feel better about themselves
